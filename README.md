#Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry
This repository contains code for performing churn prediction in the telecom industry using logistic regression. The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or cancel their subscription based on various features and usage patterns.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of customer information, including demographics, usage patterns, and the churn label. The dataset is stored in the file churn_dataset.csv (or mention the actual file name if different).
